        Get Distracted or Missed the Stop? Investigating Public Transit
        Passengers’ Travel-Based Multitasking Behaviors, Motives, and Challenges
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-xl md:text-3xl font-bold">Overview & Background</h1>
      <p class="text-lg font-medium">
        As technology becomes accessible and brings efficiency to people’s daily
        lives, people nowadays are prone to multitask everywhere, anytime.
        Travel-based multitasking is defined as when “individuals do multiple
        things concurrently while traveling”. In addition, to complete their
        primary task (e.g. reach their destination), travel multitaskers will
        also treat travel time as work-related and leisure activities usage. The
        goal of this research project was to understand travel multitaskers’
        behavior and challenges when they are in public transport so that
        providing technology design recommendations to enhance their travel
        multitasking experiences.

        ><br /><br />
        <b>Questionnaire-based survey has limitations.</b><br />
        Self-reporting methods are less reliable for the short, non-habitual
        activities and has the disadvantage of the
        <b class="text-orange-700">memory effect,</b> especially if they are not
        carried out during or immediately after travelling.<br />
        However, implementation of survey helps us collect data of travel
        multitaskers (e.g. travel mode, travel purpose, types of activities they
        perform) efficiently so that we can select participants for further
        research. <br /><br />

        <b
          >Qualitative research methods (Observation and semi-structured
          interviews)</b
        >
        can help to identify users’ multiple simultaneous activity episodes and
        understand their reasons and feelings when multitasking to better
        register their whole traveling pictures. <br />However, these studies
        require considerable resources from the researchers and provide limited
        evidence about just a few passengers. We cannot know much about the
        actual prevalence of certain activities on different modes and different
        traveller groups. <br /><br />Therefore, we decided to conduct
        mixed-methods research to bring us large scale of user profile and dive
        deeper into the specific user group we want to understand more to bring
        a efficient research process.

        Performing Tasks Suited to Public Transit’s Environment

        Some participants might intentionally deferred certain tasks until they were on public transit because they preferred to perform them there. These participants were highly familiar with the temporal rhythms of the public transit they took. (i.e. stops between journey, and time duration)

          I usually commute on the MRT from Monday to Friday. I use this time to listen to podcasts related to my work. [...] Most podcast shows are <b>thirty to forty minutes long, and the commute time is the same,</b> so I have this clear schedule in which I need to do this. But if I’m not commuting, like taking a walk, my behavior is less predictable and so <b>I wouldn’t want to listen to podcasts during that time.</b>

        The <b>high turnover rate of passengers in the small and constrained public-transit</b> environment led many participants to have several concerns about multi-tasking in such environments, including their personal property, physical health, and personal safety.<br><br>These concerns arose due to these participants’ awareness that other passengers were constantly changing and that there were many strangers with whom they might come into physical contact.

      <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl text-orange-700 border-l-orange-700 border-2">Design recommendations</h3>
      <h2 class="text-lg font-medium">
        By their sheer quantity, our findings about challenges imply that there is considerable room for improvement in the technological facilitation of multitasking on public transit.<br><br>
        Our first recommendation is to <b>take people’s motivations for travel multitasking into account when designing or redesigning public-transit infrastructure.</b> It could be accomplished via profile-building during onboarding and/or prompted questionnaires to know individuals’ primary or frequent motivations for multitasking on public transit. <br>
        Therefore, service provider such as <b>trip-planning related applications or public-transit services can provide suggestions of tasks or locations tailored to them. </b><br><br>For example, passengers who have an explicit need to complete a specific task, such as catching up on urgent work, are more likely to accept location suggestions. In addition, travel multitaskers motivated by the urgency of work are likely to concentrate strongly on their tasks-at-hand, to the extent that they might miss their stop. As such, they may need more salient cues reminding them to disembark.<br><br>
        Our second suggestion is to <b>enhance travel-multitaskers’ awareness of the characteristics of their upcoming public-transit journeys,</b> including their overall durations, the lengths of the intervals between stops, noise levels, the spatial distribution of seating and standing areas, the locations of stop-announcement displays, etc. Such information can be supplied either directly by public-transit services or via <b>crowdsourcing,</b> which has already been leveraged to obtain public-transit crowdedness information.
