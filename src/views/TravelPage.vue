        Get Distracted or Missed the Stop? Investigating Public Transit
        Passengers’ Travel-Based Multitasking Behaviors, Motives, and Challenges
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-xl md:text-3xl font-bold">Overview & Background</h1>
      <p class="text-lg font-medium">
        As technology becomes accessible and brings efficiency to people’s daily
        lives, people nowadays are prone to multitask everywhere, anytime.
        Travel-based multitasking is defined as when “individuals do multiple
        things concurrently while traveling”. In addition, to complete their
        primary task (e.g. reach their destination), travel multitaskers will
        also treat travel time as work-related and leisure activities usage. The
        goal of this research project was to understand travel multitaskers’
        behavior and challenges when they are in public transport so that
        providing technology design recommendations to enhance their travel
        multitasking experiences.

        ><br /><br />
        <b>Questionnaire-based survey has limitations.</b><br />
        Self-reporting methods are less reliable for the short, non-habitual
        activities and has the disadvantage of the
        <b class="text-orange-700">memory effect,</b> especially if they are not
        carried out during or immediately after travelling.<br />
        However, implementation of survey helps us collect data of travel
        multitaskers (e.g. travel mode, travel purpose, types of activities they
        perform) efficiently so that we can select participants for further
        research. <br /><br />

        <b
          >Qualitative research methods (Observation and semi-structured
          interviews)</b
        >
        can help to identify users’ multiple simultaneous activity episodes and
        understand their reasons and feelings when multitasking to better
        register their whole traveling pictures. <br />However, these studies
        require considerable resources from the researchers and provide limited
        evidence about just a few passengers. We cannot know much about the
        actual prevalence of certain activities on different modes and different
        traveller groups. <br /><br />Therefore, we decided to conduct
        mixed-methods research to bring us large scale of user profile and dive
        deeper into the specific user group we want to understand more to bring
        a efficient research process.

        Performing Tasks Suited to Public Transit’s Environment

        Some participants might intentionally deferred certain tasks until they were on public transit because they preferred to perform them there. These participants were highly familiar with the temporal rhythms of the public transit they took. (i.e. stops between journey, and time duration)

          I usually commute on the MRT from Monday to Friday. I use this time to listen to podcasts related to my work. [...] Most podcast shows are <b>thirty to forty minutes long, and the commute time is the same,</b> so I have this clear schedule in which I need to do this. But if I’m not commuting, like taking a walk, my behavior is less predictable and so <b>I wouldn’t want to listen to podcasts during that time.</b>
